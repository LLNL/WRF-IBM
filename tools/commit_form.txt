Description of commit types:
- "bug fix" 
  Fixing a demonstrably incorrect portion of code

- "enhancement" 
  Changing an existing portion of the code; though the old code was not unambiguously 
  wrong, this change presumably improves the code

- "new feature" 
  Adding a new feature to the code

- "feature removed" 
  Removing an existing feature of the code

- "no impact" 
  For display changes such as changing the "version_decl", changing variable names, 
  improving error messages, changing quoted Registry elements, or otherwise changing what 
  appears in the log/out/error files but not impacting history/restart output results, timing 
  performance, or memory footprint 

- "text only"
  For README and comments, changing quoted Registry elements, white space alignment, or other 
  changes which have no impact on program output or log files.  Additionally, any change which
  does not impact any of the compiled code.
